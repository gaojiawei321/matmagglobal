Matmagglobal is a Matlab program package calculate paleomagnetic field model

This program is a transition from pymagglobal, nothing now is added, but rewrite it in native Matlab code.

Following model is included:

gufm1 arhimag1k pfm9k.1a HFM.OL1.A1 CALS10k.2 ARCH10k.1 LSMOD.2 GGF100k

The accuracy validation is made by Jiawei Gao, E-mail gaojw@mail.iggcas.ac.cn

###

## Installation

Matmagglobal can be easily set up. Uncompress the Matlab code and add all the folders to Matlab path. Then, try (ggf)_try for more details. 

Coordinate, unit, and timing range are provided in annotation

## pymagglobal


This program is a transition from pymagglobal, nothing now is added.
